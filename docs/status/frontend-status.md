## QA Feedback

**Bug 6: Visibility dropdown has white background.**
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED — Applied solid dark background (`#1e293b`) to `.visibilitySelect` and its `option` children.

**Bug 7: Category dropdown has white background.**
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED — Applied same dark background to `.fieldSelect` and its `option` children in `admin-pages.module.css`.

**Feature: Dynamic Categories (replace hardcoded list)**
- **Status:** ✅ DONE
- Admin edit form: replaced hardcoded `<select>` with `<input>` + `<datalist>` populated from existing project categories. Owner can pick or type a new one.
- Public filter buttons (`Projects.tsx`): derived dynamically from project data via `new Set(projects.map(p => p.category))`.

**Feature: Social Links — Same UX as Projects table**
- **Status:** ✅ DONE
- Drag-and-drop reordering via `@dnd-kit` with GripVertical handle and auto-save.
- Visibility dropdown (Visible/Hidden) with auto-save on change, using same dark-themed `.visibilitySelect` styling.
- Removed manual ORDER column and display_order field from edit form.
